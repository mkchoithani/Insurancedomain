1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
1.1 What is Disability Insurance?
Definition: Insurance that provides income replacement when an individual cannot work due to illness, injury, or disability.
Core Purpose:

Income protection (typically 50-70% of salary)
Financial stability during health crises
Bridge between employment and recovery/return to work

1.2 Disability vs. Absence Management
Disability Management:

Long-term focus (weeks to years)
Medical condition prevents work
Insurance benefit payments
Formal claim process
Medical evidence required

Absence Management:

Short-term focus (days to weeks)
May include non-medical reasons
Employer-paid (usually)
Less formal process
May or may not require medical proof

1.3 Key Terminology
Claimant/Insured: Person filing the disability claim
Policyholder: Entity that purchased the policy (employer or individual)
Beneficiary: Person receiving benefits (usually the claimant)
Elimination Period: Waiting period before benefits begin (like a deductible in time)
Benefit Period: Maximum duration benefits can be paid
Own Occupation: Cannot perform duties of their specific job
Any Occupation: Cannot perform duties of any job suited to their education/experience
Residual/Partial Disability: Can work but with reduced capacity
Total Disability: Cannot work at all
Pre-existing Condition: Medical condition that existed before coverage began
Material and Substantial Duties: Essential functions of a job (usually >50% of duties)

2. TYPES OF DISABILITY COVERAGE
2.1 Short-Term Disability (STD)
Characteristics:

Duration: 3-6 months (typically up to 26 weeks)
Elimination Period: 0-14 days
Benefit Amount: 60-70% of salary
Coverage: Accidents, illnesses, pregnancy
Funding: Usually employer-paid or partially employee-paid

Common Scenarios:

Surgery recovery
Pregnancy/maternity
Broken bones
Mental health crisis (acute)
Recovery from medical procedures

2.2 Long-Term Disability (LTD)
Characteristics:

Duration: 2 years to age 65/67 or lifetime
Elimination Period: 90-180 days (often when STD ends)
Benefit Amount: 50-60% of salary
Maximum Monthly Benefit: Often capped ( 5,000− 15,000/month)
Funding: Employer-paid, employee-paid, or shared

Common Scenarios:

7. FINANCIAL COMPONENTS
7.1 Benefit Calculation
Base Benefit Formula:
Monthly Benefit = (Covered Earnings × Benefit Percentage) - Offsets
Covered Earnings:

Usually base salary
May include bonuses, commissions
Excludes overtime (typically)
Definition varies by policy

Benefit Percentage:

STD: 60-70%
LTD: 50-60%

Maximum Benefit:

Monthly cap (e.g., $10,000/month)
Weekly cap for STD
Limits total payout

Example:
Salary: $80,000/year ($6,667/month)
LTD Percentage: 60%
Maximum: $5,000/month

Calculation: $6,667 × 0.60 = $4,000
Benefit: $4,000/month (under maximum)
7.2 Offsets and Integrations
Other Income Offsets (reduce disability benefit):

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)

Most common offset
Includes dependent benefits
May be estimated until approved
Can create overpayment issues


Workers' Compensation

If injury work-related
Settlements complicate calculations


State Disability Benefits

SDI in California, etc.


Retirement Benefits

If taken while disabled
Pension payments


Earnings from Work

If working part-time
May encourage return to work



Offset Calculation Example:
Gross LTD Benefit: $4,000/month
SSDI Benefit: $2,000/month
Net LTD Benefit: $4,000 - $2,000 = $2,000/month
All-Source Maximum:

Total disability income limited to percentage of pre-disability earnings (often 80-85%)
Prevents over-insurance
